## ?parameters

    optional filtering on any of the context

## output:

    rows: 

        to be discussed - unclear 

    columns:

        core depending on what these go-ids look like

        [plus similar context columns as above

## way to solve

    sparql template on top of 3store

## known gaps

    needs to have sequencing data and analysis data up to triples, quite some road to go still

    unsure what the idea is to couple this to taxonomic rank? is there a link between both? can/will that be in the triples?

    concrete result-files should be considered
