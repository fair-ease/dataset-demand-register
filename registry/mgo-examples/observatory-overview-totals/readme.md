# urn:embrc.eu:emobon:observatory-overview-totals

Returns a list of observatories, with information on their names, the number of sampling events for water and sediment, the overall date coverage, and the number of samples taken.

Note: essentially same as *urn:embrc.eu:emobon:observatory-overview*,  
with some additional aggregating results on the level of the observatory

## ? parameters

    be able to filter on 1 partner (observatoryID), and probably also on type

## Output

    rows: one per observatory (see above)

    columns: see above, plus

        count of sampling-events

        min-max of sampling-event-dates

        count of samples (inside the events, typically for the various filtering fractions and then multiplied by 4, for the replicas)

        future â†’ when we get the sequencing, could be useful to have also:

            count of ena-accession-numbers

## way to solve

    see above (a) + have smart aggregating / counts

## known gaps

    see above (a)

    future question needs the omics to be present (sequencing triples)
