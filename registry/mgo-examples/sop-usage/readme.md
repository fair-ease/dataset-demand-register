# urn:embrc.eu:emobon:sop-usage

Returns, a list of used SOPs, with information on how many times each was used.
Over all observatories, list the SOPs that were used and how many times each was used (I want to see which are the popular ones).

## ?parameters

    optionally filter on any of the context fields?

## output:

    rows: one for each applied sop 

        â†’ means each row is triggered by a single triple with predicate

            sosa:usedProcedure in the case of sample and 

            emobon-sequence:sop for sequencing

    columns:

        date

        obervatoryid

        sampling-event

        sop-label 

## way to solve

    sparql template on top of 3store

## known gaps

    unclear if it makes sense to combine sosa and sequencing 

         - what kind of context-columns could they be sharing?

        or should we have two queries?
